# Practices in the Python Web Application

1. **Flask Web Framework:** The application leverages `Flask`, a lightweight and widely-used web framework for Python, which provides a simple and efficient way to create web applications.
2. **Separation of Concerns:** The application follows the principle of separation of concerns by separating the `Flask` application setup, routes, and logic into different files or functions. This improves code readability, maintainability, and allows for easier testing and reusability.
3. **Modularity:** The application is designed with modularity in mind. The logic for retrieving the current time in Moscow is encapsulated within the `show_current_time` function, promoting code reusability and making it easier to modify or extend the functionality in the future.
4. **Documentation:** The code includes descriptive comments and docstrings, such as module-level and function-level docstrings. These serve as inline documentation, providing clear explanations of the purpose, usage, and expected behavior of the different components of the application.
5. **Code Formatting:** The application adheres to a consistent code formatting style, enhancing code readability and maintainability. The Python community often follows style guides such as PEP 8, which provides guidelines for writing clean and readable Python code.
6. **Linting:** `Flake8` and `Pylint` are used as linter tools to analyze the code for potential errors, style violations, and other issues. Linting helps maintain a high standard of code quality and adherence to best practices.
7. **Unit Testing:** The application includes unit tests using the `unittest` framework. Unit tests validate the correctness of the application's functionality, ensuring that it behaves as expected. These tests can be executed to verify the application's behavior and catch any regressions when making changes.
8. **Version Control:** The application is managed with version control using a system like Git. This allows for easy collaboration, tracking of changes, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary.
9. **Configuration Management:** The application utilizes configuration files, such as `.flake8` and `.pylintrc`, to define linting rules and customize the behavior of `Flake8` and `Pylint`. This promotes consistency across the codebase and allows for easy configuration changes.
10. **Readability:** The code is written with an emphasis on readability. Descriptive variable and function names, consistent indentation, and appropriate use of whitespace make the code easier to understand, reducing the potential for bugs and improving maintainability.
